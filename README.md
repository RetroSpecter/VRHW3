# VRHW3

I started this fresh project in order to get Post Processing for Occulus working. Since it was more crucial to this assignment. 
  
HW3: Testing locomotion in VR and some other stuff. I did the assignment for motion through gestures. 

Starting instructions
HW3 sitting standing Scene: Go to Scenes/StandigSitting and hit play. You should be able to stand up above the water, but you won't be able to see anything right now. 

Hw 3 Locomotion: Go to Scenes/Locomotion and open up the scene. Then hit play. If you make a breastroke motion with your hans like you are swimming, you will move in the direction you are looking at. Then you can collect coins and stuff.

HW 3 Gaze Interaction: go to the other hw assignment 1 and 2 and see the updated files there: https://github.com/RetroSpecter/VRHW.

Also the hand model and sound effects were assets I found online. Mostly just to play around with some stuff.
