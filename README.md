# VRHW3

HW3: Testing locomotion in VR. I did the assignment for motion through gestures. 

Starting instructions
Hw 3: Go to Scenes/HW3 and open up the scene. Then hit play. If you make a breastroke motion with your hans like you are swimming, you will move in the direction you are looking at. Then you can collect coins and stuff.
