Starting instructions
HW3 sitting standing Scene: Go to Scenes/StandigSitting and hit play. You should be able to stand up above the water, but you won't be able to see anything right now.

Hw 2: Go to Scenes/HW2 and open up the scene. Then hit play.

Hw 3 Locomotion: Go to Scenes/Locomotion and open up the scene. Then hit play. If you make a breastroke motion with your hans like you are swimming, you will move in the direction you are looking at. Then you can collect coins and stuff.

Hw 3 Sitting and Standing: Go to Scenes/StandingSitting. Then hit play. 

HW 4: I added the sound in the locomotion scene. 

Also the hand model and sound effects were assets I found online. Mostly just to play around with some stuff.

# 5 ideas on how the world would look and sound differently below and above the water plane. 

1. Below water, things would be tinted blue because its underwater, where a above water ther would be no blue tint. 

2. Below water, sound would be muffled, where above water sounds would be much louder and clearer.

3. above water, the waer would feel more unsteable and look like their are larger waves around you (though we would need to balance this out so the audience doesnt get sick) while below water the surface looks and feels calmer.

4. Above water, it would feel a lot daker, while below water thigns would feel a lot more colorful. 

5. Below water, you would here a lot of aquatic sounds (bubbles, fish, orcas etc), while above water it woul dbe the rush of waves and maybe seagulls in the background.
